- **DDoS protection** with adaptive policies
- **Private Google Access** for secure connectivity

### 2. Identity & Access Management Layer
- **Zero Trust security model** with continuous verification
- **Multi-factor authentication** enforcement
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with custom roles
- **Conditional access policies** (time, location, device)
- **Identity-Aware Proxy** for application access

### 3. Data Protection Layer
- **End-to-end encryption** (at rest, in transit, in use)
- **Customer-managed encryption keys** with HSM protection
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** for sensitive financial data
- **Confidential Computing** for data processing
- **7-year retention** for financial compliance

### 4. Monitoring & Incident Response Layer
- **Security Command Center** for unified security management
- **Real-time threat detection** and automated response
- **Comprehensive audit logging** with immutable storage
- **Incident response automation** with playbook workflows
- **Compliance reporting** with automated metrics

### 5. Application Security Layer
- **Binary Authorization** for container security
- **Web Security Scanner** for vulnerability detection
- **Security keys and HSM** for hardware security
- **API security** with rate limiting and authentication
- **Secure development lifecycle** integration

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Google Cloud Project** with billing enabled
2. **Organization-level access** for policy configuration
3. **Terraform >= 1.0** installed
4. **gcloud CLI** authenticated with appropriate permissions

### Required Permissions

Your account needs these roles:
- `Organization Administrator`
- `Project Owner` or `Editor` with:
  - `Security Admin`
  - `Network Admin` 
  - `Cloud KMS Admin`
  - `BigQuery Admin`

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export PROJECT_ID="your-ipo-valuation-project"
export ORGANIZATION_ID="your-organization-id"
export TERRAFORM_STATE_BUCKET="your-terraform-state-bucket"
export REGION="australia-southeast1"
export DOMAIN="uprez.com"

# Authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
```

### Deployment

#### Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Make deployment script executable
chmod +x security/scripts/deployment-script.sh

# Run complete deployment
cd security/scripts
./deployment-script.sh
```

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment

```bash
# 1. Enable APIs
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com storage.googleapis.com \
  cloudkms.googleapis.com securitycenter.googleapis.com

# 2. Create Terraform state bucket
gsutil mb -p $PROJECT_ID -l $REGION gs://$TERRAFORM_STATE_BUCKET

# 3. Deploy infrastructure
cd security/configs
terraform init -backend-config="bucket=$TERRAFORM_STATE_BUCKET"
terraform plan -var="project_id=$PROJECT_ID"
terraform apply
```
