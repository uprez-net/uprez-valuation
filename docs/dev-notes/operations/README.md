### 1. Deploy to Staging
```bash
# Deploy latest version to staging
./scripts/deployment/deploy.sh --environment staging --version latest

# Deploy specific version with dry-run
./scripts/deployment/deploy.sh --environment staging --version v1.2.3 --dry-run
```

### 2. Set Up Monitoring
```bash
# Setup complete monitoring stack for staging
python scripts/monitoring/setup_monitoring.py --environment staging

# Production setup (with confirmation prompts)
python scripts/monitoring/setup_monitoring.py --environment production
```

### 3. Access Dashboards
