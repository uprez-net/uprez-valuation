    # Gross revenue over lifetime
    gross_ltv = monthly_revenue * avg_lifespan
    
    # Apply gross margin
    ltv = gross_ltv * gross_margin
    
    return ltv

# Tier-specific LTV calculations
insight_ltv = calculate_ltv(
    monthly_revenue=2995,
    churn_rate=0.05,  # 5% monthly churn
    gross_margin=0.85
)  # Result: $51K LTV
