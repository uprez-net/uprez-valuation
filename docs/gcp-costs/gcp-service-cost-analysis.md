## 9. Cost Optimization Strategies

### Sustained Use Discounts (Automatic)
- **Qualification**: Instances running >25% of billing month
- **Discount Rate**: Up to 30% for Compute Engine instances  
- **Application**: Automatically applied, no commitment required
- **Estimated Savings**: $150-300/month in Growth phase

### Committed Use Discounts (CUDs)
```python
cud_optimization = {
    "compute_1_year": {
        "discount": "37%",
        "minimum_commitment": "$100/month", 
        "recommended_for": "Growth phase",
        "estimated_savings": "$400-800/month"
    },
    "compute_3_year": {
        "discount": "55%", 
        "minimum_commitment": "$100/month",
        "recommended_for": "Enterprise phase",

        "minimum_commitment": "100 slots", 
        "estimated_savings": "$400-800/month"
    }
}
```

### Preemptible Instances for Batch Processing
```yaml
# Cost savings for non-critical workloads
Standard Instance: n2-standard-4 = $179.14/month
Preemptible Instance: n2-standard-4 = $53.74/month (70% discount)

# Suitable workloads
- Historical data processing
- Report generation (batch)  
- Model training and validation
- Data export/import operations

estimated_monthly_savings: $300-500 (20% of compute workload)
```

### Cloud Functions vs Cloud Run Optimization
```python
# Cost comparison for different workload patterns
light_processing = {
    "cloud_functions": {"cost": 15.00, "suitable": "Infrequent triggers"},
    "cloud_run": {"cost": 35.00, "suitable": "Consistent load"}
}

heavy_processing = {
    "cloud_functions": {"cost": 200.00, "suitable": "Short bursts"},
    "cloud_run": {"cost": 120.00, "suitable": "Sustained processing"}  
}

# Recommendation: Hybrid approach saves 15-25% on serverless costs
```

### BigQuery Slot Reservations Strategy
```yaml
# Dynamic reservations for cost optimization
baseline_slots: 100 (committed 3-year at 20% discount)
autoscaling_max: 1000 (pay-as-you-go for peaks)
flex_slots: 200 (short-term reservations)

cost_optimization:
  baseline_cost: $4,380/month (committed)
  peak_cost: $15,000/month (if using only pay-as-you-go)
  optimized_cost: $8,500/month (hybrid approach)
  savings: 43% vs pure pay-as-you-go
