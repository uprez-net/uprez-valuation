### International DR Considerations
```yaml
# International disaster recovery for compliance and business continuity
International_DR_Strategy:
  Singapore_Tertiary_Site:
    purpose: "Catastrophic Australia-wide disaster recovery"
    activation_trigger: "Both Australian regions unavailable"
    data_sovereignty: "Customer consent required for activation"
    cost_structure: "5-10% of primary infrastructure (cold standby)"
    
  Compliance_Considerations:
    data_residency: "Australian data remains in Australia during normal operations"
    emergency_activation: "Documented process for international DR activation"
    customer_notification: "Automated customer communication during activation"
    regulatory_reporting: "ASIC notification within required timeframes"
    
  Network_Architecture:
    primary_path: "Australia-Southeast1 → Australia-Southeast2"
    tertiary_path: "Australia → Singapore (emergency only)"
    data_classification: "Critical business data only to international regions"
    cost_optimization: "Minimize cross-Pacific data transfer"

Phased_International_Expansion:
  Year_1: "Australian regions only"
  Year_2: "Singapore added for APAC customers + AU tertiary DR"
  Year_3: "US West added for Americas customers"
  Year_4: "Europe West added for European customers" 
  Year_5: "Full global active-active deployment"
