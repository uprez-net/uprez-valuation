   - Present binary choice: "Do you have a draft or final Prospectus?"
   - Dynamic UI adaptation based on selection

3. **With Prospectus Workflow:**
   ```
   Step 1: Upload Prospectus
   → Document processing (OCR + NLP analysis)
   → Extract: company narrative, growth strategy, risk factors, capital structure
   
   Step 2: Define Peer Group
   → Input ASX ticker codes (5-10 comparable companies)
   → Real-time validation against ASX company list
   → Autocomplete suggestions to prevent errors
   
   Step 3: Generate Report
   → Trigger valuation engine processing
   → Display processing status with SLA transparency
   → Email and in-app notification upon completion
   ```

**Core Workflow - Path B (Without Prospectus):**
```
Step 1: Core Financials & Capital Structure
