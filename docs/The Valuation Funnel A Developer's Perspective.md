### **Step 1: Data Ingestion (The Foundation)**

This is the initial and most crucial step. The platform needs to acquire all the necessary data points. This data comes from two primary sources:

- **User-Uploaded Documents (Internal Data):** The SME and its advisors provide the company-specific information. The AI's primary job here is **OCR and structured data extraction**.
    - **Financial Statements (Audited):** To get historical performance data.
    - **Financial Model/Forecasts:** To get the **Projected Net Income**. This is a critical input that *must* come from the user.
    - **Prospectus (Draft or Final):** This is a goldmine of qualitative data for the AI to analyze (Company Narrative, Growth Prospects, Risk Factors).
    - **Due Diligence Reports (Legal, Technical):** To get a deeper, unbiased view of the company's risks.
- **API-Driven Market Data (External Data):** The platform must connect to external data providers to get real-time market information.
    - **ASX Market Data API:** To get share prices, trading volumes, and valuation metrics (Market Cap, P/E, etc.) for the **Comparable Companies**.
    - **Economic Data APIs:** To get macroeconomic indicators from sources like the **Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)** for interest rates and the **Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)** for GDP, inflation, etc.
    - **Market Sentiment APIs:** To get data like the **S&P/ASX 200 VIX Index (XVI)**.
    - **News & M&A APIs:** To scan for **Precedent Transaction** data and identify **Hype-Driven Sectors**.

### **Step 2: Analysis & Quantification (Processing the "Dimensions")**

This is the core work of the AI engine. It takes the raw data from Step 1 and turns it into meaningful, quantified factors that can be used in a calculation.

- **Industry Dimension Analysis:**
    - The platform takes the list of peer companies provided by the user.
    - It fetches their financial data via API and **calculates the median Price-to-Earnings (P/E) and EV/EBITDA multiples**. This median becomes our **Baseline Valuation Multiple**.
    - It also scans M&A data to find the multiples for precedent transactions, noting if they include a "control premium."
- **Company-Centric Dimension Analysis:**
    - This is where the platform translates qualitative data from the **Prospectus** into quantitative adjustment factors.
    - **Growth Prospects & Narrative:** The AI analyzes the language used. Strong, confident language with clear, measurable goals might result in a **positive adjustment factor (e.g., +10%)**. A vague or confusing story might result in a **negative factor (e.g., -5%)**.
    - **Risk Weightage:** The AI analyzes the "Risk Factors" section. The presence of severe, unmitigated risks (e.g., high customer concentration, unresolved litigation) will generate a significant **negative adjustment factor (e.g., -15% or -20%)**.
- **Market Dimension Analysis:**
    - **Market Sentiments:** The platform analyzes the VIX index trend. A low and falling VIX (low fear) might apply a **small positive adjustment factor (e.g., +5%)**. A high and rising VIX (high fear) would apply a **negative factor (e.g., -10%)**.
    - **Momentum/Hype:** The AI checks if the company's industry (e.g., "Artificial Intelligence," "Lithium," "Cybersecurity") is currently a trending "hot" sector. If so, it applies a **positive "hype" adjustment factor (e.g., +15%)**.

### **Step 3: Synthesis & Calculation (Generating the "Insight")**

This is the final step where everything comes together. The platform performs the calculations to generate the output section.

1. **Calculate the Target Multiple:** The platform uses a weighted formula:
    
    Target Multiple = (Baseline Multiple from Industry) * (1 + Growth/Narrative Factor) * (1 - Risk Factor) * (1 + Market Sentiment Factor) * (1 + Hype Factor)
    
2. **Calculate the Valuation Range:** It then applies this multiple to the user-provided forecast.
    
    Indicative Valuation = Projected Net Income x Target Multiple
    
3. **Calculate the Offering Price:**
    
    Price Per Share = Indicative Valuation / Post-IPO Shares on Issue
    
    To provide a "sweet spot," the platform would run this calculation with a range of plausible multiples (e.g., Target Multiple +/- 10%) to create a price range.
    
4. **Calculate the Potential Capital Raise:**
    
    Potential Capital = Price Per Share x Number of New Shares Being Issued
    

### **Example Walkthrough for a Developer**

Let's imagine a fictional company, **"AussieHealth AI Pty Ltd"**:

1. **Inputs (Data Ingestion):**
    - **User provides:** Projected Net Income of **A$3 million**. Identifies 5 ASX-listed health-tech peers. Uploads their Prospectus.
    - **Platform fetches:** The 5 peers have a median P/E multiple of **25x** (our Baseline). The ASX 200 VIX is low. "AI" is identified as a hype sector.
2. **Analysis (Quantification):**
    - **Company-Centric:** The Prospectus narrative is strong (**+10% adjustment**). However, it lists a key risk: dependence on a single government contract (**20% adjustment**).
    - **Market:** Market sentiment is positive (**+5% adjustment**). The company is in the "AI" hype sector (**+15% adjustment**).
3. **Calculation & Insight (Synthesis):**
    - **Target Multiple:** 25x * (1 + 0.10) * (1 - 0.20) * (1 + 0.05) * (1 + 0.15) = 25 * 1.10 * 0.80 * 1.05 * 1.15 = **26.5x**
    - **Indicative Valuation:** A$3 million * 26.5 = **A$79.5 million**
    - **Price Per Share:** If they have 50 million shares post-IPO, the price is $79.5M / 50M = **$1.59 per share**.
    - *The platform presents the "Sweet Spot" as a range, e.g., **$1.45 - $1.75 per share**.
